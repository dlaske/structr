The paging controls allow you to limit the number of elements that are displayed in the current view. Please note that the larger this number is, the more time a server request needs to fetch and the browser to display the data.

You can use the "Prev" and "Next" buttons to navigate to the individual pages, or enter a page number into the input field to directly jump to the page with this number. You can control the page size by entering the desired number into the "Page Size" input field. Most object lists in Structr are paged.

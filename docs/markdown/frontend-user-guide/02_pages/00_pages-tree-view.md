The "Pages Tree View" is located on a slide-out on the left-hand side of the "Pages" main view. It contains a pageable list of all pages in Structr with their complete structure as a folding tree.

To access inner elements, just click on the <img src="/structr/icon/tree_arrow_down.png" style="display:inline"/> arrow icon to expand/collapse the branch. When you hover over an element, its outline will become visible, the background color changes to a darker grey and a number of icons will become visible in the top-right corner.

You can sort the children of an element by drag and drop. To move elements within a page, just drag and drop them from the source element to the target element.

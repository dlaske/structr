The Dashboard is the central view of Structr's internal graph visualization. Initially, it is empty. On the left-hand side, there are three slide-outs where you can issue queries, set some visualization and filter options. Queries can be saved locally.

The above picture shows the graph of an imported page. You can tune visualization parameters using the sliders in the panel, toggle relationships, or particular node or relationships types.

You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel and pan the canvas by moving the mouse while holding down the left mouse button on the canvas.

By dragging single nodes, you can move nodes around. The lower the center force is, the easier can a node be moved.

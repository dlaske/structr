The Schema Editor allows you to extend the built-in data model or schema with custom data types by either creating new node types one by one, or importing Cypher code, f.e. contained in a GraphGist.

There are buttons to expand and collapse the schema nodes. The details view opens when you click on the edit icon. Please note that since 1.0.RC3, you can also edit schema relationship properties.
